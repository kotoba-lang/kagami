(ns kagami.pin-kotoba-parity-test
  "`kagami.pin` (the running cljc) vs `src/kagami/pin_core.kotoba` (the
  decision core), compiled at test time and executed through the pinned KIR
  interpreter.

  This is step 1 of the dual-source pattern (kotoba-lang handoff §2): the
  `.kotoba` is parity-bound, not yet authoritative — see the header of
  `pin_core.kotoba` for why the authority move is a separate slice.

  The facts adapter in this namespace is the seam a future host adapter would
  be: it does the walking and the crypto calls (host mechanism) and hands the
  guest only scalars. It deliberately does NOT pre-decide anything the guest
  can judge from a scalar: the signer string crosses raw, so 'is this signer
  well-formed' is decided exactly once, in the guest.

  Reason literals are pinned (`reason-literals-are-pinned`): if `pin.cljc`
  renames a reason, this suite fails on the rename itself, not only on
  disagreement — an assertion that would stay green under a rename on both
  sides at once is not discriminating the thing it names."
