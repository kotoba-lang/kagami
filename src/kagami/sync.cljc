  "Pure sync planner (ADR-2607160005 Plane 5, Phase 0).

  Given a repo entity + observed workspace state, produce the git argv steps
  that materialize the checkout at the pinned revision. Pure: no IO here —
  the nbb CLI executes plans through an injected runner (same pattern as
  kotoba/git_adapter.cljc). Because every plan targets the pin SHA DIRECTLY
  (`fetch origin <sha>`), the shallow-vs-pin mismatch class and local
  ancestry judgments do not exist in this planner: there is nothing to judge,
  only a SHA to materialize. That property comes from naming the SHA, not
  from the depth — the depth was the thing that broke it (ADR-2607211600).

  west semantics kept: a dirty checkout is skipped, never overwritten. And a
  checkout already AT its pin plans nothing — `:noop` is what makes this the
  cheap way to bring a workspace to the manifest, where `west update` walks
  every project and runs git in each regardless."
