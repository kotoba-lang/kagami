  "Signed reachability receipts (ADR-2607160005): make pin reachability a
  REPLICATED, SIGNED attestation instead of a per-node clone. One node that
  has verified a pin (via reach-local-git) signs a receipt; other fleet nodes
  fetch it over p2p and trust it (signer ∈ trust set, fresh enough) — so they
  need NEITHER a clone NOR the gh API. This is fleet.ci's receipt shape
  applied to reachability, and it removes the last per-node GitHub touch the
  clone-based provider still had.

  Pure cljc; sign/verify/hash injected. A receipt attests: repo, pin,
  default-branch tip observed, reachable?, value-advance?, at, signer."
