;; fleet serve — real p2p HTTP transport (ADR-2607160005 P3b). A fleet node
;; serves, over plain HTTP, the artifacts other nodes need so they don't touch
;; GitHub: the signed fleet head, signed reachability receipts, and (stub)
;; object bundles. This replaces the "message EDN passed by hand" demo with an
;; actual network endpoint.
;;   serve --head <fleet-head.edn> --receipts <reach-receipts.edn> --port 8778
;; Endpoints:
;;   GET /head                 -> the signed fleet head (EDN)
;;   GET /reach?repo=&pin=     -> a signed reachability receipt for that pin
;;   GET /health               -> ok
